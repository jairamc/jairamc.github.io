title: Hadoop at Datasift
---
I had the chance of giving a talk at the Edinburgh University [Student Tech-Meetup](https://comp-soc.com/compsoc/page/home) on the 6th of February, 2013. The idea was to give the audience a flavour of how we use Hadoop at [Datasift](https://datasift.com) and what were the lessons we had learnt. Below are the slides from the talk.
