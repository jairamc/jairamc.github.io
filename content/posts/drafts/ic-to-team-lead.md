title: Individual Contributor to Team Lead
draft: true
---

That thought or phase that so many of us software engineers tussle with. Should I continue along the Individual Contributor path or should I consider becoming a Team Lead and potentially go down the management path.

## Why this blog?
- Capture my experience in the last 12 months
- Its a decision I had been contemplating and I know others are curious about
- The experience has been great, well-supported
- The TL role is allowing me to explore management without fully committing to it

## Introduction
I joined Meltwater in Aug, 2018 as a Senior Software Engineer. I was made the Team Lead for Team Wrapidity on the 1st of January, 2022. This is an account of my experience of that transition - going from a senior IC to a Team Lead.
The change from IC to TL so far has been a lot like going through the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle). It is not surprising that the Gartner Hype Cycle is based on the same model as the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
## The Trigger
When my manager informed me that my name was being put forward to take the role of Team Lead (TL), I remember being quite excited. While I wasn’t exactly working towards a management role, I was at that point in my career where I would’ve had to make that choice sooner rather than later. I was mostly aiming to continue on the IC track, but the TL role was a good opportunity that I did not want to let go.
The expectation from a TL role at Meltwater R&D is - 50% people management, 50% hands-on coding. And subsequently, you have the choice of going back to an IC or to an Engineering Manager (EM) role. This was perfect! I could officially keep my feet in two boats at the same time and eventually see which one I wanted to jump into. This was the first time I had come across a role which the company acknowledged was a transition role. I will go into a bit more detail on what that meant in reality shortly. In the past, whenever I found myself in a similar role, the expectation somehow was to be 100% manager and 100% developer. And I would soon be finding reasons to go back to IC roles.
## Peak of Inflated Expectations
So, I was told that I was going to be the TL in early November, 2021. And shortly after that, I was added to a number of slack channels, mailing lists, meetings and planning sessions. And all this was making me feel important. People were showing faith in my abilities and I was given the responsibility and opportunity to leave a mark (however small) on the future of this company. I had a number of ideas that I was in a hurry to implement. I was well aware that I was filling in some pretty big shoes left by the previous Team Lead / Manager. But I was brimming with optimism that I could quickly make an impact.
### Getting accepted as a TL
The first thing I wanted to accomplish was to get accepted by the team as the new TL. We are a good mix of new-blood and old-guard. I was already an established senior engineer in the team and it felt relatively smooth with the new-blood. But with the old-guard, I suddenly went from being their peer and pal, to their manager, and at least for me, this was a little awkward. Having said that, I have some amazing colleagues. We sat, spoke about it, addressed the elephant in the room and it has been great.
### Anxiety about the new responsibility
So far, for the most part, I had a clear set of tasks as an IC. But now, I had to make plans and roadmaps. I had to think about other people’s careers. I had to start managing upwards, downwards and side-ways. I’m usually not one to shy away from a challenge, but this was a lot of responsibility. Thankfully, right about this time, I had enrolled for the first Meltwater Mentorship program for R&D. And I cannot emphasise enough the utility of having a mentor. I was paired up with someone who had gone through a similar transition in his career and I could talk to them about everything I was going through and get some advice. At the very least, it was good to know that someone else had had the exact same experience as me.
### Management support
One of the things that was genuinely heartwarming about the Meltwater culture was the immense support I got from everyone. My team, my manager, my peers, upper management - everyone was very supportive. I was given a wide-berth to get a hang of the new role. I was also given a lot of suggestions on how to deal with various responsibilities and what I should be looking out for. For instance, I was told to go easy on myself and give myself time to settle-in to the role on multiple occasions. My manager and I also discussed the best ways to keep timely feedback flowing.
### Diving into the role
The first things that I dived into were those that I was not responsible for as an IC. I built roadmaps in JIRA, tried to tweak the team processes, set up one-on-one-s, sprint planning - the works! And it felt good. I felt energised. And I was getting positive feedback too. But there were a few things nagging me at the back of my head.
## Trough of Disillusionment
### Imposter Syndrome
Yes, that well-known devil. I wouldn’t call myself an insecure person in general. But when you are responsible for an entire team, you cannot help but ask yourself - am I doing the right thing? Am I doing right by others? If you are expecting me to give you an answer on how to overcome this feeling, I’m sorry, I don’t know. You just sort of learn to live with it. And if you look from a slightly different perspective, this isn’t entirely bad. This is what keeps you honest. This might be what makes you good at the end of the day. I’ve asked this to the most senior people I know and they all claim to suffer from it.
### Too many things to do, too little time to do it in
I was an eager-beaver at the beginning. I wanted to do too many things without thinking about how to fit it all into a coherent timeline. It is a lot easier to take action when you are on your own. Quite a different ballgame when there are many more stakeholders and conflicting priorities. I had to come to terms with the fact that something will take time to get done, and some, we might never get to. That neatly brings me to the next heading.
### Learning to let go
Not everyone thinks like you, not everyone works like you. In fact, most others will have a different working style and a different problem-solving approach. And it is surprisingly hard to let go of control. You might think that if you delegate, you will have more time for other things. But implicit in that delegation is the trust you place in others to solve a problem. And they will almost certainly not solve it the way you would. Not better, not worse, just different. Appreciating this is sometimes still hard for me. But has become easier over time.
### Not enough time to code
This hit me hard very early on. Even during the exciting phase of a new role, I was getting pulled into a lot of discussions and meetings and I started having less and less time for coding. This meant that I was struggling to finish my tickets in the sprint. My mentor gave me an advice that made a lot of sense. They suggested that I should avoid taking up any tickets in the sprint, but instead let someone else in the team lead the work and I should assist. This will improve the knowledge in the team and stop me from blocking others. This is good advice and one that I adopted as much as I could. But I’m a coder at heart and this was not the easiest thing to do.
## Slope of Enlightenment
### Meeting the team in-person
### The first big delivery
### Improved confidence
### Time management
## Plateau of Productivity
### Time management
Yes, that heading is repeated. Because so far, the one thing that has been more important than anything else has been time-management. If people tell you something, they need to have faith that you will take timely action on that information.
### Delegation
## The future
