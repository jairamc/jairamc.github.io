Title: Welcome to my website
Description: These are the musings of a software engineer when he can find some time

I'm a [programmer](https://xkcd.com/303/) living in [Maidenhead, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead). I'm also
a [geek](https://xkcd.com/747/) and proud to be one.

I currently work as an Engineering Team Lead at [Meltwater](https://meltwater.com) where I help my team design cloud 
based solutions for crawling and annotating the unstructured world of the Internet.

My main area of interest are distributed technologies. I have worked with [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org), [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Hive](http://hive.apache.org), and [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org).
