- Hadoop - Main analytics engine
  - Played a major role in integrating and smooth functioning of the analytics cluster with the data-store. Primarily responsible for generating analytics data using Map/Reduce programs written in Java. Using the knowledge gained, gave a [talk][cassandra-podcast] at a public meet-up. Podcast available [here][cassandra-podcast]
- Hive
  - Most of the services hosted on the cloud, events system logs reside on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Responsible for running Hive queries over these logs using [Amazon Elastic MapReduce](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/).


## Relevant Education

### MSc - Computer Science [Awarded Distinction]
(Sept 2009 - Sept 2010)

#### School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, U.K.)

Specialization Modules -

- Design & Analysis of Parallel Algorithms
- Advance Databases
- Distributed Systems
- Parallel Programming Languages & Systems
- Human Computer Interaction
- Compiler Optimisation
- Text Technologies & Information Retrieval
- Querying & Storing XML

Course work -

- **Dissertation - Join algorithms using Map/Reduce** - Evaluated existing join algorithms used in contemporary systems that use Map/Reduce. Designed two new algorithms for multi-way joins. Properties like selectivity factor of a join were exploited in design of the algorithms. The project was implemented using **[Hadoop][hadoop]** and **HDFS**. The coding was entirely done in Java. The evaluation was done based on speed-up, scale-up and network I/O. The thesis was awarded distinction and is available for [download][dissertation] from the University website [here][dissertation]
- **Advanced Databases** - Extended the query engine of a home grown database to implement External Sort and Merge join algorithms. I managed to secure 100% in the coursework and the work was appreciated to be the best amongst the batch.
- **Information Retrieval** - Developed a web crawler (using Python) capable of harvesting a set of hyper-linked news stories from a web-server. Implemented content-extraction algorithm using plateau-based method. Also implemented near-duplicate detection feature using SimHash algorithm. Also developed a system for searching images based on keywords (tags). Implemented exact-match, best-match and pseudo-relevance feedback algorithm.
- **Querying and Storing XML** - Implemented an algorithm for updating XML via Relational Databases with 2 other collaborators. The project involved incrementally updating recursively stored XML, stored in an existing relational database, as opposed to previous approaches that shred the entire XML document into a newly created database of a newly designed schema.
- **Distributed Systems** - Implemented a simulation of Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm which is used in distributed systems for recording a consistent global state of an asynchronous system.

##  Previous Work Experience
