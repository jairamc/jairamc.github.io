Having some time at my hand over the weekend, I decided to try out [Garage Band][1]. The last time I tried to compose music was almost a decade ago.

I have not used any live instruments for this one. I do plan to hopefully give that a shot in the future. I feel pretty satisfied with the result today given that I spent just about 3 hours on it. I hope you like it too.
