Last year at [Hadoop UK User Group Meetup][1], I gave a talk on use of Hadoop at [Datasift][2]. This was part of [Big Data Week][3], London, 2012. Below are the video and slides for that presentation.

Although this presentation is now quite a bit out of date, it does mention some of important lessons we learnt using and managing a Hadoop eco-system. For a more recent presentation, see my [last post][4].
